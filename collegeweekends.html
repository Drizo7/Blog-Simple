        <h2>What Goes On?</h2>
        <hr/>

        <div>

          <p>Ask two different people about their weekend in college, they will tell you two different things . While some others will prefer partying the weekend away, would rather be alone and relax by watching a movie. While others will study the weekend away. No matter what you prefer we all need to rewind after a long tiring week. My experience with life during the weekends in college is quite interesting. I have seen it all. Literally. If you like partying you probably know one rule, what you when you are drunk is none of sober's you concern. Party weekends are probably the most chaotic things ever. Usually these things end with someone vomiting all over. Despite all the chaotic  happenings of weekend parties it's a great way to socialize. You meet new people with similar interests or completely different interests but you still can get along with them. The college weekend experience is something you can experience only once unless you go through college again. To be around people you can relate to at the same have fun forgetting all the past weeks experiences is good for your health. There is also nothing wrong with just sitting in your room alone and watching a movie or having a chat with friends. It's perfectly fine. For those who study during the weekend, I have no words only a question. Do you enjoy school that much? </p>

        <h2>Fun Things You Can Do That Don't Involve Alcohol... </h2>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <div>

          <p>You are probably thinking does every weekend college involve alcohol? The answer is no. There are some many ways you can have fun with out getting white girl drunk. My favourite one would be watching weekend games wether it be football, net ball or any other sweaty sport. I mean if you play sports join a team, it's a great way to remove stress and tension from the chaotic life at college. If you don't do sports, be wild out of compass and spend a little. Shop all those worries away with friends. However if you love to be stressed and bombarded with questions you could always visit your family over the weekend. I am not judging you but personally I don’t like leaving college for home for any reason during the weekend. </p>

        <h2>Things I Hate About College Weekends...</h2>
        <hr/>
        <br/>
        <div>

          <p>Weekends in college might sound fulfilled but  there is a dark side. Usually a Friday night party will leave you with a hangover in the morning that will leave you unable to do anything productive . IT’S either you are puking the life out of yourself or so dizzy  you think the world fast forwarding it's rotation. Or my personal favourite a head ache so bad you can hear you future boss screaming at You. However nothing beats the rumours that leave you scared  for life, well Unless you are the one spreading them. Moral of the story don’t talk about the weekend or shame anyone for trying to have fun. Another thing about weekends at college is when there is nothing to do. Cause that's when it hits you I have school to do. Honestly, it's depressing. </p>
