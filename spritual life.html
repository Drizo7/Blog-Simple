      <h1>TAKING CARE OF YOUR SPIRITUAL WELLBEING AT COLLEGE</h1>

      <h2>It's Not Easy...</h2>

        <p>No matter how spiritual you are, college has a way of  turning your life upside down and left side right. Whether you are Christian, Muslim, Hindu or believe in the great circle of life and the kings of our past, we can all agree that maintaining our spiritual life at college somewhat difficult. I myself being Catholic, the was a time I forgot how to say the apostle's creed. It had been that long. The first few weeks of college we always promise yourself that I will go to my respective place of prayer and spiritual enlightenment every week. Then school gets tough. We start giving excuses like “just this week I need to rest.” Or “let me just finish this reading assignment I mean I will go next week". Then the vicious cycle begins. You see yourself becoming more distant from your spiritual being and in the end you just stop going completely.</p>

      <h2> "IT'S BEEN WAY TOO LONG! I CAN'T JUST START GOING AGAIN"</h2>

        <p>Look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself yes I  can. Or whatever motivational cringe line you can come up with. You don’t need a reason to start going again. You are probably thinking they are judging me. No they are not. If they are I would advise you to change your denomination. Cause the place where you go to grow spiritually is supposed to be a judgement free zone. A place you can go just cry and let all of the negative energy go, a place you can go for moral support and freely let go of your sins. If you don’t feel comfortable doing that what is the use of going. I mean there is no room for spiritual growth. So find a place that allows you to grow spiritual and won’t judge you for your mistakes.</p>

        <h2>"MY SCHEDULE IS HECTIC! I HAVE NO TIME"</h2>

          <p>Unless you spend every evening attending worship sessions and delivering people from their demons, you have time. You just have to make it. You can set aside one day for spiritual growth and usually you don't spend the whole day praying.  That is why planning is important. I mean once you are able to integrate your spiritual life with your academic life Successfully you can actually see things change for the better. You feel freer and that stress from school doesn’t hit you as hard. Things don’t get easy they just become more bearable. You are able to release your grievances to a being that won’t judge you or think you are seeking attention. </p>

      <h2>Let's share experiences...</h2>

      <p>Tell me your religion and does it keep you afloat when things get rough? Do you enjoy going?<p>
