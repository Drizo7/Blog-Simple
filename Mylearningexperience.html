<h2>What It's Like...</h2>

  <p>My learning experience at Malawi University of Science and Technology is an amazing experience to me as a student. It is totally different from when I was in high school. Here, you wake up anytime you want, you can choose to skip class and nobody even tells you what to wear. They say college life is the best and that is really true. Apart from that, as a student I have gradually developed my academic skills and realized that I have to change my learning style to be able to integrate with the University environment. Getting good grades is important but here at University you just need to get 50 percent and you proceed. The lectures are interactive but sometimes they become so boring that they make you sleep. Some sit in a 2 hour lecture class and yet they don't understand anything. Its called "kumwetsa uli momo" at our University. We're given assignments or even projects to be done at a specific time, but we only submit it when it's due the next day or a few hours away. Some don't even submit it within that specified time. That's what my University experience is like, it's totally insane. </p>
